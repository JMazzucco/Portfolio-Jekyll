Edit Edit Edit - your first copy will suck

## HTML + CSS ##

-Create basic layout of About page
-Link front page images to posts
	  -a new post should auto insert a new linked image, title and description at the top left corner of the front 	page.
	  -
-Create simple buttons for repo and site links.
		- opaque body, 1px border that changes color on hover
-Better font for menu items
-font size, line height, letter spacing, etc - fine tuning sexiness
-Menu item underlined when page is loaded

## JS ##

-spinner when loading the image
-Fade in menu then site content like shown in Betakit site
-navbar that hides/shows/opacity on scoll
-menu dropdown for mobile. Rest of site darkens and disables
-Animates menu items underlines on hover

	-On hover, show title and links to site, repo and case study
-jquery effect when hovering over portfolio piece: show title and description
-jquery fade in logo (maybe)
-split up the logo in Illustrator. Fade in border and J separately on page load- spin the border?
-Install SlickNav plugin for mobile menu - add a CSS animation: X to hamburger
-Add a sub-menu to the posts. Menu lists each heading: Design, Dev, etc. Find a way to include this in mobile menu:
	 About
	 Resume
	 Work

	 probably not needed - the posts aren't too long.
	-----------------------
	 Case Study:
	 Overview
	 Desigm
	 Dev
	 What I learned
 ^^ if the menu is this long, use the menu that slides in from the left and pushes page

## General ##

-Clean up and refactor code
-Add bourbon, sass, neat variables and mixins where possible - really challenge your Sass skills. Create your own mixins, functions, extends, etc

-Standards compliant -- w3c etc
-Works on all browsers or has fallbacks
-Install Modernizer

-Add a "Practice" page that lists app features, css animations, tutorials, codepen, dribbble,  --- small things with a short description

-widen boxes for mobile
-mobile: always show title and description since users cant hover
-Mobile: add spaces between boxes
-overlay pics of work peices with a color layer- style them in PS
